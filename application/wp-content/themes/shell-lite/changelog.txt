- IE7 Dropdown Menu: Fix for dissapeering menu over images.
- Long Titles Menu: Fix for menu with longer titles.
- Blog Section: Adjustment for (You're in all Blogs Section).
- Modernizr: Update from v1.7 to v2.0.6.
- Child Theme: Shell Child Theme style.css correction.

For more control over Child Themes we decided to add unique IDs to:

- archive.php #content-archive
- blog.php #content-blog
- images.php: #content-images

These changes should not affect your Theme in any way because the grid class
still remains the same and they will change only if you add styles to them.

- shell-child-theme.zip: is now removed because the it was not needed. You
still have regular non-zip Child Theme sample included.
- blog-excerpt.php Template was added for user who does not want full posts.
blog-excerpt will shorten your post and include "See more" link. And if you
still want full posts simply use blog.php Template instead.
- PHP headings filesource had wp-content/shell instead of wp-content/shell-lite.
This does not affect nor changes anything, it's just to avoid confusion.
- Post Data CSS margin-top:20px was added.
- Author Meta (Author's Box) was added. The meta will display once you enter
your Biographical Info, otherwise it will not display.
- Textdomain bugs in comments.php, footer.php and functions.php
- Modernizr version bug fixed.

- Shell is now translation-ready, please see /shell-lite/languages/ folder.
You can use Codestyling Localization Plugin and start translating Shell
into your own language: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/

- Bug fix in functions.php
require_once ( get_template_directory() . '/includes/hooks.php' ); was not needed
because we're calling hooks directly from /includes/functions.php
